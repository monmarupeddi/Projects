### Data Science Concepts Practice

#### This collection of executed notebooks coded in R covers various Data Wrangling, Analysis and Science techniques performed on multiple datasets.
**Goal:** The main goal is to 
  * Identify and explain the basic concepts, terminology, models, and methods used in the field of
data science and machine learning.
  * Perform data wrangling tasks, including filtering, selection, transformation, and other data
manipulation techniques, on diverse datasets.
  * Acquire the skills to effectively visualize data, using various techniques and tools to
communicate insights and patterns.
  * Develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills specific to data science by working on real- world data sets.
Build the ability to translate raw data into meaningful insights, enabling them to derive actionable knowledge from data sets.
  * Utilize the R language for data analysis, data visualization, and data mining, demonstrating proficiency in its application for data science tasks.
  * Apply machine learning algorithms to different datasets, selecting and implementing appropriate models for regression, classification, and clustering tasks.
